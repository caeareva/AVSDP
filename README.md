## Analysis and Visualization of Scientific Data in Python

A collection of programs written in raw <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
to analyse scientific data from biological experiments. Each program could be optimized and 
implemented based on data. All programs were written to be executed in the <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/command_line/read/introduction">command-line</a> interface and could be slightly modified to 
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook.

More programs will be added overtime, enjoy!
