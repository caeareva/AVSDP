## Analysis and Visualization of Scientific Data in Python

Repository provides a collection of programs written in raw Python (https://www.python.org/)
to analyse scientific data from biological experiments. Each program could be optimized and 
implemented based on data. All programs were written to be executed in the command-line interface
(https://launchschool.com/books/command_line/read/introduction) and could be slightly modified to
Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/).

More programs will be added overtime, enjoy!
