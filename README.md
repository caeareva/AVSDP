## Analysis and Visualization of Scientific Data in Python

This repository provides a series of programs written in raw python to analyse
your scientific data from biological experiments. Each program was designed to be 
run in the command-line interface (in your computer terminal) but could be slightly
updated for Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/).

More programs will be included overtime!
