## Analysis and Visualization of Scientific Data in Python

This repository provides a collection of programs written in raw Python to analyse
your scientific data from biological experiments. Each program was designed to be 
run in the command-line interface (in your computer terminal, 
https://launchschool.com/books/command_line/read/introduction) but could be slightly
updated to Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/).

More programs will be added overtime, enjoy!
